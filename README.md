### Hi there! üëã I'm Oscar Sinaga

I'm a **Data Engineer** specializing in building and optimizing data pipelines, with a strong passion for **Machine Learning**. I have hands-on experience designing data architectures from the ground up and transforming raw data into actionable insights.

I believe in the power of data to drive intelligent business decisions and am always excited to learn new technologies within the data ecosystem.
